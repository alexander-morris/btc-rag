# Bitcoin RAG System Improvement Tests

## Baseline Results (Current)
- Chunk size: 1000
- Chunk overlap: 200
- Retriever k: 4
- Temperature: 0.2
- Model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229

### Sample Question Results
1. "How does the CheckTransaction function validate Bitcoin transactions?"
   - Confidence: 0.75
   - Sources: 2 files (validation.cpp, validation.h)
   - Quality: Poor - Could not find actual implementation
   - Query Time: ~3.5s

## Planned Experiments

### Test 1: Adjust Chunk Parameters
- Decrease chunk size to 500 (to capture more focused context)
- Increase overlap to 300 (to maintain continuity)
- Expected outcome: Better function-level context capture

### Test 2: Adjust Retrieval Parameters
- Increase k to 6 (more context)
- Add MMR reranking with diversity_bias=0.3
- Expected outcome: More diverse and relevant context

### Test 3: Improve Prompt Engineering
- Add system context about Bitcoin Core architecture
- Request specific code references in the answer
- Expected outcome: More technical and precise answers

### Test 4: Source File Filtering
- Focus on core implementation files (.cpp) first
- Filter out test files unless explicitly requested
- Expected outcome: Reduce noise from test files

### Test 5: Subsystem Classification
- Enhance subsystem keyword matching
- Add file path based classification
- Expected outcome: Better subsystem targeting

## Running Tests

Each test will:
1. Make a single change
2. Run the standard test questions
3. Record:
   - Answer quality (relevance, accuracy, detail)
   - Source document relevance
   - Query time
   - Any errors or issues

## Results
